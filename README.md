# LFGBuddy

LFGBuddy addon is designed to help you find buddies for dungeon groups efficiently with a somewhat automated whisper queue.

## Usage

1. Choose your filter by class and level range.
2. Click "Refresh" to create the whisper queue.
3. Click "Whisper who?" to see to who the addon intends to send your message to.
4. Click "Send" to start whispering everyone in the queue, pause and reset the queue if needed.

## Features
**Whisper queue** 
Players in instances, on your ignore list and optionally in pvp zones will not be put into the queue.


## ✨ Features

- **Automate asking buddies if they want to tag along for an instance** 
   – Automatically builds a whisper list with a class/lvl filter.  
   – Skips players in ignored zones, PvP zones (optional), or on your ignore list.  
   – Keep track of recently sent messages for quick reuse.
   – By default, the addon will only send a message to a player once every 10 minutes to avoid being a nuissance.
   – LFGBuddy is positioned next to the Who tab for easy access.
